This repository holds files relevant to my Master of Bioinformatics Research Project: Non-Canonical Thyroid Hormone Signaling Identification of Target Integrin Subunits in Metastasis &amp; Development.

## Project Summary

This project investigates the potential for **non-canonical thyroid hormone signaling** in sea urchins through **RGD-binding integrin receptors**.

In humans, thyroid hormone metabolites such as T3 and T4 bind to the integrin **αVβ3**, initiating rapid, transcription-independent signaling. While sea urchins lack a direct ortholog of αVβ3, they express several integrin heterodimers—such as **αVβG**, **αVβ1-A**, and **αVβC**—that may serve analogous functions.

Using **AlphaFold-Multimer**, candidate sea urchin integrins were structurally modeled, followed by **molecular docking** of six thyroid hormone metabolites using **HADDOCK 2.5**. Binding affinities were calculated with **PRODIGY**, and structural comparisons with human αVβ3 were performed.

The results highlight **αVβG** and **αVβ1-A** as promising functional analogs of human αVβ3, based on favorable docking scores and high interface confidence. These findings support a possible conserved mechanism of thyroid hormone interaction in echinoderms, offering insights into the evolution of integrin-mediated signaling.
